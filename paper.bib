               advancing the understanding of cellular functions and diseases

               around for two decades, it remains nascent. It has witnessed
               rapid evolution, accompanied by emerging challenges. These stem
               from various factors, notably the growing complexity and volume
               of data together with the increased diversity of data types
               describing different tiers of biological organization. We discuss
               prevailing research directions in network biology, focusing on
               molecular/cellular networks but also on other biological network
               types such as biomedical knowledge graphs, patient similarity

               shaping an individual's disease vulnerability. This review
               highlights the associations among genetics, environment, and
               health. Environmental epigenetics significantly impacts disease
               susceptibility through mechanisms like non-coding RNAs, histone
               modifications, and DNA methylation, responding to external
               stimuli and dynamically interacting with genes. Lifelong
               epigenetic imprints, influenced by the prenatal environment,
               early experiences, diet, chemical exposures, and lifestyle,
               dictate health trajectories across the lifespan, elevating the
               risk of various illnesses, including cancer, cardiovascular,
               metabolic, and neurological conditions. Major findings
               demonstrate how antenatal environmental factors—like mother's
               diet, food and stress level—shape fetal epigenetic programming
               and impact health consequences in the future. Furthermore, it has
               been demonstrated that environmental pollutants and dietary
               nutrients can modify epigenetic markers, highlighting the crucial
               role that lifestyle decisions have in reducing the risk of
               disease. Significantly, the notion that epigenetic alterations
               may be passed down through generations raises the possibility
               that environmental exposures may have an impact on health
               consequences for future generations. Environmental epigenetics
               revolutionizes our understanding of gene-environment interactions
               and their role in disease etiology. The study concludes by
               highlighting the revolutionary implications of environmental
               epigenetics for comprehending the etiology of disease and
               customizing public health approaches, and by promoting the
               incorporation of both genetic and environmental components within
               public health frameworks. The knowledge acquired calls for an
               evolution of paradigms in medicine toward customized care
               utilizing epigenetic biomarkers and calls for more studies to
               improve therapies that lessen the harmful epigenetic consequences

               (GWAS) is an arduous task for researchers. Investigating single
               nucleotide polymorphisms that correlate with specific diseases
               needs statistical analysis of associations. Considering the huge
               number of possible mutations, in addition to its high cost,
               another important drawback of GWAS analysis is the large number
               of false positives. Thus, researchers search for more evidence to

              genes that are likely to be involved in the mechanisms of a given
              disease, providing a ranking of such genes. Recently, the research
              community has used computational methods to uncover unknown
              gene-disease associations; these methods range from combinatorial
              to machine learning-based approaches. In particular, during the
              last years, approaches based on deep learning have provided
              superior results compared to more traditional ones. Yet, the
              problem with these is their inherent black-box structure, which
              prevents interpretability. RESULTS: We propose a new methodology
              for disease gene discovery, which leverages graph-structured data
              using graph neural networks (GNNs) along with an explainability
              phase for determining the ranking of candidate genes and
              understanding the model's output. Our approach is based on a
              positive-unlabeled learning strategy, which outperforms existing
              gene discovery methods by exploiting GNNs in a non-black-box
              fashion. Our methodology is effective even in scenarios where a
              large number of associated genes need to be retrieved, in which
              gene prioritization methods often tend to lose their reliability.

               progressive early-onset neurodegenerative disorder, autosomal
               recessive spastic paraplegia type 79. In this study, we
               investigated heterozygous UCHL1 variants on the basis of results
               from cohort-based burden analyses. METHODS: Gene-burden analyses
               were performed on exome and genome data of independent cohorts of
               patients with hereditary ataxia and spastic paraplegia from
               Germany and the United Kingdom in a total of 3169 patients and
               33,141 controls. Clinical data of affected individuals and
               additional independent families were collected and evaluated.
               Patients' fibroblasts were used to perform mass
               spectrometry-based proteomics. RESULTS: UCHL1 was prioritized in
               both independent cohorts as a candidate gene for an autosomal
               dominant disorder. We identified a total of 34 cases from 18
               unrelated families, carrying 13 heterozygous loss-of-function
               variants (15 families) and an inframe insertion (3 families).
               Affected individuals mainly presented with spasticity (24/31),
               ataxia (28/31), neuropathy (11/21), and optic atrophy (9/17). The
               mass spectrometry-based proteomics showed approximately 50\%
               reduction of UCHL1 expression in patients' fibroblasts.
               CONCLUSION: Our bioinformatic analysis, in-depth clinical and
               genetic workup, and functional studies established
               haploinsufficiency of UCHL1 as a novel disease mechanism in

               radically changed as a consequence of the new challenges posed by
               climate change, environmental degradation and emerging infectious
               diseases. The awareness of the influence of distal causes (e.g.
               planetary changes at the roots of new pandemics), of the social
               environment and of early life exposures calls for innovative
               models of disease onset. Here we propose a scheme for the
               practice of epidemiology and toxicology that incorporates new
               recent advancements in both disciplines, under the general
               umbrella of the ``exposome''. The exposome approach to disease
               encompasses a lifecourse perspective from conception onwards, and
               the investigation of the role played by all exposures individuals
               undergo in their lives. These include social inequalities and
               psychosocial influences, in addition to chemical, biological and
               physical exposures. We stress the role played by social
               differences and inequalities in the course of life as an
               overarching factor that influences downstream layers (including
               behaviours). We show that the idea of ``lifecourse exposome'' is
               compatible with the current interpretation of Adverse Outcome
               Pathways in toxicology, and in fact we propose an extension of
               the concept towards ``lifecourse Adverse Outcome Pathways''. We
               propose to merge different research perspectives and promote an
               encounter between the sociological perspective of ``biography''
               (using Pierre Bourdieu's conceptual framework) and biology,
               according to the idea of accumulated biological capital of
               individuals. We also propose to treat social capital (including
               inequalities) no longer as a confounding factor but as an
               overarching determinant, perhaps the most important of all
               because it is the one that influences all other exposures
               downstream. The importance of early exposures in a lifecourse
               perspective leads to policy implications, i.e. investing more in
               the various forms of capital (social, economic, cultural) in
               early life.",

               has contributed to improving medical care and to a better
               understanding of gene functions, interactions, and pathways.
               However, there are well over 1500 Mendelian disorders whose
               molecular basis remains unknown. At present, methods such as
               linkage analysis can identify the chromosomal region in which
               unknown disease genes are located, but the regions could contain
               up to hundreds of candidate genes. In this work, we present a
               method for prioritization of candidate genes by use of a global
               network distance measure, random walk analysis, for definition of
               similarities in protein-protein interaction networks. We tested
               our method on 110 disease-gene families with a total of 783 genes
               and achieved an area under the ROC curve of up to 98\% on
               simulated linkage intervals of 100 genes surrounding the disease
               gene, significantly outperforming previous methods based on local
               distance measures. Our results not only provide an improved tool
               for positional-cloning projects but also add weight to the
               assumption that phenotypically similar diseases are associated
               with disturbances of subnetworks within the larger protein

              and preliminary experimental evidence for positional changes of
              TREs within a dynamic, functional nuclear architecture. We suggest
              a multilayered shell-like chromatin organization of chromatin

              chromatin typically located in the interior. This model

              accessibility of TFs to targets located in co-aligned active and
              inactive nuclear compartments (ANC and INC). It is based on
              evidence that active, easily accessible chromatin (perichromatin
              region, PR) lines a network of channels (interchromatin
              compartment, IC) involved in nuclear import-export functions. The
              IC and PR constitute the ANC, whereas transcriptionally
              noncompetent chromatin with higher compactness is part of the
              likely less accessible INC. Preliminary experimental evidence
              shows an enrichment of active TREs in the ANC and of inactive TREs
              in the INC suggesting positional changes of TREs between the ANC

  abstract      = "Graph neural network (GNN) and label propagation algorithm
                   (LPA) are both message passing algorithms, which have
                   achieved superior performance in semi-supervised
                   classification. GNN performs feature propagation by a neural
                   network to make predictions, while LPA uses label propagation
                   across graph adjacency matrix to get results. However, there
                   is still no good way to combine these two kinds of
                   algorithms. In this paper, we proposed a new Unified Message
                   Passaging Model (UniMP) that can incorporate feature
                   propagation and label propagation with a shared message
                   passing network, providing a better performance in
                   semi-supervised classification. First, we adopt a Graph
                   Transformer jointly label embedding to propagate both the
                   feature and label information. Second, to train UniMP without
                   overfitting in self-loop label information, we propose a
                   masked label prediction strategy, in which some percentage of
                   training labels are simply masked at random, and then
                   predicted. UniMP conceptually unifies feature propagation and
                   label propagation and be empirically powerful. It obtains new

              Nanopore sequencing are limited, and the selection of the optimal
              tool presents a challenge, there is a need to create a tool based

               network frameworks. Random walks, for instance, have been
